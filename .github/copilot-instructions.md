- Website types include:
  - Portfolio sites  
  - Blogs  
  - Landing pages  
  - Dashboards  
  - Any other common website type  

## Styling
- Use a mix of:
  - **Tailwind CSS**  
  - **Plain CSS (modules/global)**  
  - **Styled-components**  

## Content
- Sometimes use **dummy/random data** (Lorem Ipsum, Unsplash images, fake projects).  
- Sometimes leave **placeholders** for the user to fill.  

## Features
- May include extra features like:  
  - Footers  
  - Animations  
  - Dark mode toggle  
  - Contact forms  
  - Blog pagination  
  - Other standard components  
-complete checks from _features.md file after completing its task

## Code Style
- Add **comments only for parts that may confuse a beginner** (like routing, APIs, styled-components).  
- Otherwise keep code clean.  

## Setup Instructions
- Sometimes include **project setup steps** (`npx create-next-app`, install Tailwind, etc.).  
- Sometimes skip them and only give code.
